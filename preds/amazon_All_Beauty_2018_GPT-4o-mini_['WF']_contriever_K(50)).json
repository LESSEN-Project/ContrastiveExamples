They eliminate itchy dry skin and make bath time something to look forward too.\n\nProduct:\nWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser\nReview:\nWhen i was 16 my dentist told me to buy a Waterpik as an alternative to flossing which I didn't like then or now. Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.\nThis model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.\nOther than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.\nThe Waterpik is easy to use and maintain and has  paid for itself many times over since I never buy floss.\n\nProduct:\nFekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Cond Us 6.6 Oz, 6.660-Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nThis product is dispensed from an aerosol can. On the face of it I thought it was a mousse product. Fortunately, I read the instructions. While the product didn't indicate that the can needed to be shaken, I shook it and then dispensed a small amount in the palm of my hand and worked it through my towel dried hair. I left it on for 3 minutes and then rinsed thoroughly. I lightly towel dried my hair again and blow dried my hair with a rounded hair brush starting at the roots. My hair looked as though it had more volume, but I subsequently repeated the process this morning and applied my regular mousse before styling. My hair looked better despite the initial benefits of just this conditioner alone.\n\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulates sentence, compared to other writers:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['hair', 'waterpik', 'water', 'product', 'teeth', 'tips', 'dried', 'buy', 'flossing', 'many']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.\n\nI went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.\n\nI had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.\n\nI started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.\n\nMy dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)\n\nRegarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.\n\nSo when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)\n\nHmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)\n\nThe dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!\n\nProduct:\nCrest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse, Cool Wintergreen, 33.8 Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nCrest has a bunch of specialized mouth rinses, and the Pro-Health Multiprotection rinse in Wintergreen is one of the best.\n\nThere's no alcohol in it, so no pain or stinging when you swish it around, but the taste of wintergreen lasts long and gives a refreshing taste that lingers in the mouth.\n\nI've been working hard on reversing the gingivitis in my mouth through a variety of methods. My dentist has been very pleased at my progress. Crest Pro-Health products are part of that regimen. Depending upon your taste, I can't recommend them highly enough.\n\nProduct:\nKate Somerville&nbsp;ExfoliKate Intensive&nbsp;Exfoliating Treatment&nbsp;(5 Fl. Oz. Luxury Size)\nReview:\nI have good skin, and I try just about every skin treatment product to keep it that way. A friend suggested I give Kate Someville's ExfoliKate a try...I was just a little astonished at the price! Even the samples aren't cheap on ebay (cheaper than on Amazon for the .25 ounce sampler size if you want to give this a whirl before you make a heavy investment.)\n\nNow I can see why! This has to be the fastest and most potent skin care product I've ever tried.\n\nThe product comes out as a pretty malachite green, with a nice, fresh smell. You massage it onto clean, wet skin, and the directions said to let it sit for up to two minutes. It feels a little warm, but not unduly so; there are those little microbeads so many skin treatments have nowadays.\n\nMy skin is hardy, so I let it stay on my skin for five minutes before I rinsed it off.\n\nWow...just wow! My skin looks phenomenal, and it feels as smooth as a baby's bottom.\n\nI was weighing buying a Clarisonic, but after this treatment, I can't see how my skin could better! I'm going to invest in the big tube - I can see ExfoliKate has earned a permanent place on my beauty treatment shelf.\n\nListen to what people are telling you; this really is THAT good.\n\nProduct:\nOZNaturals Anti Aging Retinol Serum -The Most Effective Anti Wrinkle Serum Contains Professional Strength Retinol+ Astaxanthin+ Vitamin E - Get The Dramatic Youthful Results You&rsquo;ve Been Looking For\nReview:\nI'm totally loving the OZ skin care line, and this retinol serum is an excellent addition! Works very gently but decisively in skimming off dead cells to reveal new, healthy skin. It absorbs quickly and isn't greasy. I added it to my nighttime regimen and within a week, my complexion was experiencing a really radiant, healthy glow, and all without redness or irritation.\n\nI'd also add that OZ products are, by and large, an excellent buy. This container was enormous and should easily last six months. I can't recommend this skin care line highly enough.\n\n**Product was provided for my honest review.\n\nProduct:\nCrest Pro-Health For Life CPC Antigingivitis/Antiplaque Smooth Mint Rinse 33.8 Fl Oz\nReview:\nI got this and passed it along to my husband and mother, and neither of them can figure out why it's marketing to the over 50 crowd. I'm not quite there (yet), but I tried it. I don't like it nearly as much as other Crest Pro-Heath products - the wintergreen is a much better and more long lasting mouth rinse.\n\nBoth my husband and mother think the over 50 thing is a gimmick. Neither would buy it themselves.\n\nI'm a fan of Crest Pro-Health products, but I definitely wouldn't be buying this one. No particular advantages for older users, it has an unpleasant taste, and it just seems a like cheesey to market it as such.\n\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulates sentence, compared to other writers:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['skin', 'dentist', 'enough', 'waterpik', 'good', 'teeth', 'said', 'people', 'little', 'crest']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Floral, but much more interesting than the usual floral scents. The performance is also top-notch with a nice amount of lather and a very creamy feel. It does not dry out my skin at all.\n\nThe price makes it more of a \"treat\" than an everyday soap, but it's a very nice treat indeed.\n\nProduct:\nOral-B Glide Pro-Health Dental Floss, Original Floss, 50m, Pack of 6\nReview:\nI've always had a problem with flossing since it's so difficult to work the floss between some of my teeth. I tried this on a recommendation from my dentist and it's made a world of difference. This floss is more like a tape than conventional floss, and just slips through the tightest spots without any difficulty. It's also very comfortable on the gum line, and rarely breaks in use. I can't say it makes flossing fun, but it certainly makes it much easier.\n\nIf you're a Sam's Club member you can get this in the 6-pack for a little better price. Highly recommend for those who find regular floss too difficult to use.\n\nProduct:\nWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser\nReview:\nThis is an outstanding product!  I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!\n\nTo get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.\n\nI agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).\n\nThe water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.\n\nSound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.\n\nThe auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.\n\nIn actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.\n\nGood performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.\n\nProduct:\nCrest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse, Cool Wintergreen, 33.8 Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nWhile I like non-alcohol-based rinses, I was not pleased with this. On the plus side, it provides the same benefits as other rinses and does it without the burning sensation I get from those with alcohol. Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).\n\nBut how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than \"fresh mint\" tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.\n\nI'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.\n\nIf you like really sweet tasting rinses this may be worth a shot. For me, however, it was not something I'd use again.\n\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulates sentence, compared to other writers:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['water', 'nice', 'get', 'would', 'use', 'rinses', 'floss', 'like', 'unit', 'reservoir']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I can usually get about 3 days before I start to see the first chip. I then touch it up with some polish and put a new topcoat on and that will get me another day, but after that it's chipping badly enough that I need to redo my nails.

I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash burn, so the strength of it is usually the first thing I notice when trying out a new mouthwash. My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it. I haven't had any issues with this mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband. So it seems to work well. It leaves your breath smelling great and lasts quite a while. I like this wintergreen version a bit more than the mint, since I've always been a fan of the more refreshing taste of wintergreen.\n\nOne thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this mouthwash, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope). Some people, myself included, have a sever food allergy to Yellow #5 and can't use or eat anything with that food coloring it it. For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead to create the mouthwashes green color. The Crest Pro-Heath mouth wash in the Invigorating Clean version, which is an even greener colored mouthwash, also doesn't use Yellow #5, and used #6. So anyone with this food coloring sensitivity who wants to try these out, can do so knowing these won't have Yellow #5 in them.\n\nProduct:\nFekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Cond Us 6.6 Oz, 6.660-Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nTo starts, I am so glad I checked the reviews here for the experience of others. Like a lot of others, I put this in my hair and left it, like one would do with a leave in product. And that was actually okay for my hair, since it's not that I have fine hair, but that I've cut it from being long and thick, to a shorter and thick hair style. A style that needs a lot of body and not be weighed down by heavy products, or else I don't get the desired effect.\n\nBut that's not how this product is designed to work. It's supposed to be washed out in the shower. This works very well for making hair soft but light and fluffy. And it really worked well for my teen daughter, who has very fine thin hair. Normally she can't use any conditioner in her hair. She's at an age where her hair is getting very oily every single day, and already having very fine thin hair, the two are a bad combination. So she has to use clarifying shampoo every day, and no conditioner, just to keep her hair nice.\n\nThis conditioner however is so light and washes away well in the shower, that she can use it to help soften her hair without completely weighing it down and adding to her oily hair issues. It also has a very nice citrus cent to it. This is so nice I may just keep buying this for her, as it's definitely made for her hair type more than my own.\n\nProduct:\nCrest Sensi-Stop Strips, 10 Count\nReview:\nThese seem to actually work. They help bring down tooth sensitivity a bit more effectively that just tooth sensitive tooth past. They're more concentrated, and you leave them in your mouth for a longer period of time (10 minutes). They are just small strips, meant for applying to portions of your mouth. It's not a whole mouth piece for all your teeth. The directions mention it might take a few treatments to get the desired level of sensitivity relief, with at least one day between treatments.\n\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulates sentence, compared to other writers:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['hair', 'mouthwash', 'use', 'crest', 'well', 'yellow', 'get', 'skin', 'burn', 'fine']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It does leave a little aftertaste and it doesn't have fluoride which is helpful for people with sensitive teeth.\n\nProduct:\nPre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry\nReview:\nPr de Provence is known for the large blocks of savon de Marseille made with olive oil that are especially suited for use in the kitchen, but these newer artisanal bars are easier to handle.  They are made with vegetable oil only, no animal fat, and are quadruple-milled to last a long time.  They contain glycerin and shea butter as moisturizers, so that they don't dry out the skin as much as some soaps do.\n\nThe variety of fragrances is impressive, and they all smell so nice that its hard to decide on a favorite.  Agrumes (citrus) smells distinctly of grapefruit with lemony notes and the verbena smells as fresh as if you had just plucked a leaf from the bush and crushed it in your hand.  The almond, pomegranate, and mirabelle (plum) will make your mouth water.  The florals such as violette and angels trumpet are a pleasant change from  offensive artificial floral scents.  The milk, coconut, and green tea are more subdued fragrances and are a good choice for people who don't like strong fragrances.  They are all made with mostly natural ingredients, and some even have visible bits of almond, pomegranate, sage, etc.\n\nProduct:\nCrest Pro-Health For Life CPC Antigingivitis/Antiplaque Smooth Mint Rinse 33.8 Fl Oz\nReview:\nCrest Pro-Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing, alcohol-free mouth washes.  It has a pleasant minty flavor.\n\nThe active ingredient is 0.07%  cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic.  Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treating gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time.  However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems.  Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.\n\nI also prefer a stronger, more astringent mouthwash with fluoride.\n\nSo while I would recommend this mouthwash for people with gingivitis, I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use for people with healthy teeth and gums.\n\nProduct:\nPantene Pro-V Volume Conditioner 12.0 Fluid Ounce (Product Size May Vary)\nReview:\nThis would be a good conditioner to use every day as it rinses cleanly but leaves the hair shiny and easy to brush.\n\nThe floral fragrance is very noticeable but fades.\n\nProduct:\nDove Men+Care, Deep Clean Body + Face Bar, 4 Ounce, 6 Count, (Pack of 2)&hellip;\nReview:\nDove Men + Care Body and Face Bar in Deep clean has a very neutral odor best described as simply soapy with no noticeable perfume except for maybe the slightest hint of sandalwood so it is not so much masculine as definitely not feminine. It cleans quite well but has moisturizers so it doesn't leave the face feeling dry but rather soft and smooth. There are some visible small black \"purifying grains\" in the ivory-colored bar but perhaps also something else that provides a very gentle exfoliation. This bar is ideal for both men and for women who don't like strongly-perfumed soaps.\n\nProduct:\n Colgate Fluoride Toothpaste Strawberry Smash Liquid Gel 4.60 oz (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nThis toothpaste is a translucent gel with the sweet flavor and fragrance of old-fashioned bubble gum.  It is green rather than pink, which seems just as odd to me as purple ketchup.\n\nThe convenient pump dispenses the correct pea-sized dose that is recommended for brushing.  Children should still be supervised to make sure that they don't swallow the toothpaste to avoid fluoride toxicity.\n\nThe plastic container stands upright and holds 4.4 oz. or 124 g.  It has a cap that is easy to remove and replace but which smears any excess toothpaste left on the pump dispenser.  The dispenser opens and closes automatically so that the cap is not needed in routine use.  The safety-sealed containers that I received have an expiration date 16 months from receipt.\n\nActive ingredient:  Sodium fluoride 0.24% (0.14% w/v fluoride ion).\n\nInactive ingredients:  Sorbitol, water, hydrated silica, PEG-12, cellulose gum, sodium lauryl sulfate, flavor, sodium saccharin, mica, titanium dioxide, D&C Yellow No. 10, FD&C Blue No. 1.\n\nProduct:\nCrest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit, 1 Count\nReview:\nThe Crest + Oral-Professional Gingivitis Kit has an electric toothbrush plus timer and case, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash in a disposable tote bag. There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  I have been using an Oral-B 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.\n\nThe charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts. At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings. There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.\n\nThis model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  I don't really like the timer feature but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.\n\nThe brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users. The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip. It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems. I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle, though.\n\nIt is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque. Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  I find this helpful.\n\nThere is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  I probably wouldn't bother with the weight and bulk when traveling and will continue to carry a manual toothbrush.\n\nNo complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the handle shows water and toothpaste residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush. I do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features. An electric toothbrush would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.\n\nProduct:\nFekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Cond Us 6.6 Oz, 6.660-Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nThis thick foam conditioner has a complex scent dominated by citrus and mint.

The scent was just over-powering in the shower.\n\nThis bar though is mild in comparison and very pleasant.  About on par with the normal pink or green Dove bar soap that we sometimes purchase.  (I think the white has the least smell.  White Dove is our household standard.)\n\nSecond, I like how it didn't dry out my skin.  It's Winter and my skins a dry mess right now, but this bar doesn't appear to be making the situation worse.\n\nSo definitely would recommend.\n\nProduct:\n Colgate Fluoride Toothpaste Strawberry Smash Liquid Gel 4.60 oz (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nI'm a mom that likes to purchase in volume so this works for me.  The 6 tubes come in a sturdy box so I can take one out and stow the rest in an organized fashion.\n\nPersonally, I am not a bubblegum toothpaste enthusiast.  It's way too sweet tasting and too 'dramatic' for me early in the morning.  The kids though love this toothpaste.  Even the teens are more enthusiastic about brushing because of the flavor.\n\nI know some moms don't like fluoride, but our kids have a weak enamel problem and fluoride is a must.\n\nActive Ingredients: Sodium Fluoride 0.24% (0.15% w/v Fluoride Ion)\n\nInactive Ingredients: Sorbitol, Water, Hydrated Silica, PEG-12, Cellulose Gum, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Flavor, Sodium Saccharin, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, D&C Yellow No. 10, FD&C Blue No. 1\n\nProduct:\nCrest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse, Cool Wintergreen, 33.8 Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nI've tried 3 Crest Mouthwashes in the last month and this one is definitely the best.  The wintergreen taste was appealing to everyone in the family that uses mouthwash, and I found that the fresh feeling lasted for a very long time.\n\nThe best part about this mouthwash for my family is that it doesn't have alcohol.  Thus this bottle is going in the children's bathroom.  Not that they would be stupid enough to drink mouthwash, but currently my daughter is on medication where any form of alcohol is best avoided.\n\nProduct:\nCrest Pro-Health For Life CPC Antigingivitis/Antiplaque Smooth Mint Rinse 33.8 Fl Oz\nReview:\nAt first taste, the Crest Pro-Health for old folks seems pretty good.  There's no alcohol and consequently there is none of the tingly sensation some of us are accustomed to.\n\nAfter using it, your breath is definitely minty fresh... BUT there's a weird chemical after-taste that lasts and lasts; which my husband and myself found to be unpleasant.\n\nOn the non-pro-health side, it's a chemical concoction.  It contains \"propylparaben\" which is know to mimic estrogen.  It also contains Red 33, which can be found in Cutex Nail Polish remover.\n\nNow really, given that we are adults-over-50, can't we just have clear mouth wash.  Or whatever color the Cetylpyridinium Chloride gives the liquid.  Because that's the only active ingredient: Cetylpyridinium Chloride.  (also used in some pesticides because it fights fungus.)\n\nCan't recommend.\nI really prefer a mouthwash that doesn't put my tastebuds out of action for hours at a time.  Also, my dentist insists that I use something with Floride to protect my tooth enamel, which this product doesn't have.\n\nProduct:\nColgate Enamel Health Mouthwash\nReview:\nMy teen has been using this mouthwash for about two years.  I'm not sure why but both of my children have had a problem with cavities.  I believe it's because we have well water which isn't fluoridated.  We have always been brushers.\n\nMy son I can't quite get used to using the mouthwash, but my daughter does and I'm sure it's the non-alcoholic nature of the wash that makes it acceptable as it's not that sting-y.\n\nSUMMARY\nSince my young teenagers are using this mouthwash I wanted one without alcohol.  My daughter uses it on a regular basis and for about two years.  It's impossible to say whether the mouthwash has worked or if the kids are just flossing and brushing more effectively, but they have had fewer cavities and improved dental reports.\n\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulates sentence, compared to other writers:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['mouthwash', 'alcohol', 'using', 'bar', 'dove', 'fluoride', 'definitely', 'fresh', 'found', 'also']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I think that if you apply the strip, close your mouth and don't talk, eat, or keep touching  the strip with your tongue, you will have a better chance of it staying put. You are supposed to leave them in place for 10 minutes and you cant eat for 30 minutes. I have had a problem with sensitivity to cold as I have gotten older.

Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved.

What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.\n\nI poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.\n\n~ Kort\n\nProduct:\nWiseWays Herbals Witch Hazel Salve 1 oz.\nReview:\nMy wife uses this for skin irritation (and prevention) and swears by it.

The bamboo side is just rough enough to exfoliate without feeling like you are scouring your skin, and the jute side is soft and has a \"polishing\" effect. Both sudz up nicely with body wash and should work well with salt or sugar scrubs as well. It is easy to slip on and has a handy loop for hanging and drying in the shower.\n\nThe natural bamboo and jute mitt is a little small on my hand (6ft tall man) but it works. It should be fine on smaller hands. I'm a hairy guy and some of my body hair does attach itself to the mitt even after thoroughly rinsing and wringing out. That doesn't bother me, but it might limit shareablity with my wife. I also worry that over time it might get a musty smell since it takes a while to dry, but as long as I keep using it with soap, I hope that it won't be an issue.\n\n~ Kort\n\nProduct:\nPhilips Sonicare UV Sanitizer\nReview:\nI would have to say that this is probably a good niche product and nice gift for someone who already owns a compatible toothbrush.  It is a handy place to store the brush heads in a sanitary manner (if you believe that the UV light kills the bacteria).\n\nThat said, for $50 plus S&H is a bit much for brush storage and cleaning.\nThe recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and I've never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  Rinse thoroughly after use and tap to get the water out, that should be enough in my opinion.  As the \"biologist\" stated in his review, this seems a bit like overkill.\n\nThis is a simple to use product that probably does what it says.\nBut I think I'll give mine to family member who also uses Sonicare brushes and may appreciate more the gadget geekiness of the UV Sanitizer.\n\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulates sentence, compared to other writers:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['product', 'good', 'lavender', 'brush', 'well', 'enough', 'use', 'water', 'like', 'kort']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I could smell it as I was opening the box it was shipped in, not an overpowering fragrance, but an inviting one that made me want to unwrap it and go take a shower with it. It's funny how some soaps are overscented with an artificial smelling fragrance and others have a very natural fragrance that I just can't get enough of. This soap it's definitely the later. This is the perfect soap for someone like me, who isn't a morning person, to have in the shower. It makes me feel good and puts a smile on my face - even early in the morning. It makes me want to linger in the shower just to experience that fragrance. It's a good thing that it's shea butter enriched. It keeps my skin from feeling dry, even it a hot shower.\n\nThis soap lathers really well and seems to be fairly hard milled since it isn't shrinking too fast, even with repeated use.\n\nProduct:\nToni&amp;Guy Glamour Volume Plumping Whip, 2.82 Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nI have shoulder length hair that is kind of thick but very fine and straight. I used this Toni&Guy Volume Plumping Whip to give my hair a little volume and lift at the crown. A lot of volume adding products are too heavy and just weigh my hair down, but this one was different. I applied a little less than the walnut sized amount that they recommend to the roots of my hair right after shampooing and messaged it it, then blow dried it. It was light, so my hair wasn't weighed down and it gave it a small amount of lift and volume. My hair looks clean and not dull or sticky like some products. Realistically, I think the amount of volume that it added was about the max that I'm going to be able to get without weighing down my baby fine hair while still leaving it looking clean and shiny, so I'm giving this product 5 stars.\n\nProduct:\nPantene Pro-V Volume Conditioner 12.0 Fluid Ounce (Product Size May Vary)\nReview:\nThis Volume Conditioner shampoo by Pantene does a nice job of conditioning my shoulder length, fine textured hair without weighing it down like some conditioners I've tried in the past. It has a nice fragrance that I would call \"flowery\" that leaves behind a mild fragrance after drying. I've always liked Pantene's shampoo and conditioner fragrances.\n\nThe thing I like best about this conditioner is that it leaves my hair tangle-free after conditioning. If I don't use a conditioner at all, my hair is just a tangled mess that is very difficult to comb out. The texture even feels different. This conditioner leaves it feeling smooth even when it's still wet. It's a good product at a reasonable price.\n\nProduct:\nUrban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized\nReview:\nThese Urban Spa Moisturizing Gloves are a very effective way to moisturize your hands when they're dry and rough from gardening, household chores or dry cold weather. Simply use your favorite oil or moisturizer and then slip on these gloves. They keep the creams or oils on your hands instead of having it get all over the bedding while you sleep. In the morning, your hands feel softer and smoother, having been bathed in moisturizers all night. This can be very good for fingernails as well. If you have dry, brittle or peeling nails, the moisture will help to condition them. These gloves ensure that the hand or nail products stay on your hands or nails.\n\nI washed these in cold water the first time, but it was difficult to get much of the oil I used removed from them. The next time I used warm water that seemed to work better, with no detrimental effects to the gloves that I could see. They feel soft and hold up well.\n\nProduct:\nessie Gel Couture Nail Polish\nReview:\nI don't think any nail polish manufacturer creates as many different colors of nail polish as Essie, and I like almost all of them! This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look. But with so many beautiful Essie colors, why would you want to?\n\nThis polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. The top coat was still extremely shiny. My nails show growth at the base of the nail, so I usually change polish after 7 days. But if not for that, I probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish. Great product!\n\nProduct:\nFekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Cond Us 6.6 Oz, 6.660-Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nThis Fekkai Foam Conditioner is unusual for a foam in that the directions say to apply to wet hair after washing, wait 2 - 3 minutes and then rinse out. Normally foam conditioners are left in the hair and then dried and styled as usual. In fact, that's what I did the first time. It worked pretty well but left just a slight bit of heaviness to my fine hair.  Then I read the directions which I should have done before using it. The next couple times I used it as instructed and I liked the results better. It seemed to add a little volume and body to my fine hair. It didn't do a super job of detangling though. The foam is very full and luxurious. The dispensing mechanism is nice because it puts quite a large amount in your hand with only a light touch. It makes it very easy to use.\n\nI love the fragrance which smells like fresh grapefruit and citrus. It's very natural scent, not like something cooked up in a lab. It's one of my favorite things about the product. After drying my hair the fragrance went away so I wouldn't have to worry about it conflicting with my cologne.\n\nProduct:\nCrest Sensi-Stop Strips, 10 Count\nReview:\nThese strips work to numb pain or cold sensitivity on teeth where the gum exposes a tiny bit of the dentin at the base of the tooth. Sometimes acidic foods can irritate this area and cause sensitivity. These strips are very easy to use. You just press one of the straps against the tooth and gum that is hurting and leave it in place for 10 minutes. I was really surprised that this actually worked and continued to work for several days. I am on the seventh day now and my tooth feels just slightly sensitive again. I do eat a lot of acidic foods and drink kombucha which is kind of sour so that may contribute to the strips not lasting as long. But I still think they offer a definite benefit and start to work quickly.

The scent is hard to describe. It smells a little floral and a little spicy on the bar. When I shower with it, I pick up more of a sandalwood scent. The scent is very strong from the bar and I smell it in the bathroom, but it doesn't linger on the skin so it won't clash with your perfume. The soap leaves my skin feeling very clean and it doesn't dry it out.\n\nI've used Pre de Provence soaps in the past and have always had good luck with them. The soap is hard milled and doesn't melt away too quickly. I have a wooden Pre de Provence retail display box that is about 10 years old and it still smells like their soap. My grandmother used to tuck scented soaps in her dresser drawers to keep her linens smelling fresh. This soap would be perfect for that.\n\nProduct:\nPre de Provence Maison French Dried Lavender Blossoms for Fragrance\nReview:\nI buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.\n\nThat said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.\n\nProduct:\nToni&amp;Guy Glamour Volume Plumping Whip, 2.82 Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nI had to practice with this product a little before I felt good about the results. It can be sticky and make my hair feel greasy if I use too much, so I have to be careful. If I don't use enough, then it doesnt' really do anything. After I used it a few times, I felt like I had learned the best way to use it for my thin hair and make it look fuller and thicker. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of whip in the small jar, so I wasted quite a bit practicing with it. I'll definitely buy another jar, though, because I like the results. It's not something I plan to use every day, but it will help me feel good about my hairstyle when I want it to look nice and full.\n\nProduct:\nUrban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized\nReview:\nI really like this nail brush from Urban Spa. The curved shape of the wood as well as the bristles makes it easy to grip when scrubbing under my nails. The wood is smooth and has a light finish on it. The thin row of bristles is cut short and it's stiff, so it really gets under the nails to remove garden dirt or anything else. The other side of the brush has a wider row of slightly softer bristles that clean the skin well. The brush dries quickly after use. Shedding is minimal. Overall, this is a handy little nail brush. I find it much easier to use than the plastic ones that are one-sided.\n\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulates sentence, compared to other writers:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['lavender', 'use', 'provence', 'scent', 'little', 'soap', 'pre', 'de', 'like', 'nice']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It has some moisturizing ingredients (caprylic/capric triglycerides, glycerin, aloe, sodium hyaluronate, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil).  It has some antioxidants (from the tea leaf extract).  The moisturizing effects may help diminish the appearance of fine lines; hyaluronate, for example, holds on to a lot of water and may have a plumping effect.  I don't have much in the way of fine lines, but I am not really seeing a difference in the ones I do have after applying this every morning for awhile now.\n\nFor what it's worth, this does have some silicones in it.\n\nIf you have really sensitive eyes and can't use most other eye creams, this could be an option for you.  It is non-irritating, even when used on sensitive/thin skin.  I have been using this in the morning before putting in my contact lenses and it doesn't bother my eyes at all.  You don't need a lot at once so one container will last a long time, making this a pretty good value.\n\nBut, in the end, I feel like this is not the eye cream for me.  I am looking for something with a few more active ingredients designed specifically for the eye area.\n\nProduct:\nOral-B Glide Pro-Health Dental Floss, Original Floss, 50m, Pack of 6\nReview:\nI was finally convinced to start flossing regularly when a dentist told me I was showing the early signs of gingivitis.  That probably happened something like 15 years ago.  This is not the cheapest floss out there, but it really is the only one I can stand to use.  I just hate the waxy feeling of standard dental floss, but Glide is so much smoother.  (I am reminded of this every now and then when I run out of Glide and have to use free floss samples from the dentist until I can run to the store to restock.)\n\nI started using Glide floss when I got braces (had them from age 25-28!).  I got tired of shredding floss on all the little wires, brackets, etc., and then trying to have to get it unstuck.  Glide wasn't 100% shred proof, but it outperformed any other floss I tried, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with dental work to maneuver around (I had a wire glued to the back of my bottom teeth after my braces were removed, so I am stuck with a minor amount of dental work for life).\n\nUnlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't even notice the change from original Glide (GoreTex) to the current product.  Well, I noticed the package was different, I suppose, but I felt like the product was still quite good.  I find it to be quite strong and not easily breakable (have even used it to sew up holes in dog toys).\n\nProduct:\nWhish Coconut Shaving Cream - Smooth, All Natural Shave Cream for Men &amp; Women, Leaves Skin so Soft, Shea Butter and Coconut Oil, Natural and Organic Skin Care - 5 oz. pump\nReview:\nAs a shaving cream, this performs well.  It's moisturizing and it washes off without leaving residue.  It works even with razors that are kind of dull (which is good, because I forget to change my razor out as often as I should) -- I didn't cut myself at all.\n\nBecause this isn't a foaming product, you do have to use more than you would with some competing products.  I found it non-irritating, too.  (You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the main product page.)\n\nThis does have a strong smell.  I kind of like it, but I have heard from plenty of people who detest the scent.  It's an artificial blueberry sort of scent.  So if you have reactions to strong fragrances, you may want to stay away.\n\nProduct:\nWhish Coconut Shaving Cream - Smooth, All Natural Shave Cream for Men &amp; Women, Leaves Skin so Soft, Shea Butter and Coconut Oil, Natural and Organic Skin Care - 5 oz. pump\nReview:\nThis was OK but nothing amazing. I did like the smell (fruity) and I appreciate that it doesn't seem to have any artificial dyes since my skin is sometimes sensitive. Please note that while this does contain some plant oils and extracts, it also contains artificial fragrance.\n\nWhen distributed from the container, it has an airy texture. However, it doesn't foam terribly well, so when you spread it out over the area to be shaved (I used it on my lower legs), it can be hard to see. (I could feel it, though, if I ran my finger over my legs.)\n\nI do think this helped in terms of providing a close, fairly smooth shave. My legs were soft afterwards, though I did also use a body lotion.\n\nHere are the ingredients since I didn't see them on the product page:\n\nWater, Stearic Acid, Myristic Acid, Squalane, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Organic Coconut Oil, Glycol Distearate, Fragrance, Organic Jojoba Seed Oil, Organic Pomegranate Oil, Organic Green Tea Leaf Extract, Organic Shea Butter Fruit, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrahydroxypropyl Ethylenediamine, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol, Limonene.\n\nProduct:\nKate Somerville&nbsp;ExfoliKate Intensive&nbsp;Exfoliating Treatment&nbsp;(5 Fl. Oz. Luxury Size)\nReview:\nI got this in a beauty subscription box.  I've had it for so long I forget which box.  I needed a new exfoliator so I grabbed this from my stash.\n\nHere are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:\n\nWater, Lactic Acid, Polyethylene, Soybean Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pectin, Papaya Fruit, Lactobacillus Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dehydroxanthan Gum, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, SD Alcohol 40-B, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Sorbic Acid, Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, Honey, Acetic Acid, Lavender Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bromelain, Papain, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Rosewood Wood Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Orange Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Cinnamal, Beta-Carotene (CI 75130), Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex (CI 75810).\n\nThis is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  It has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  I have seen all of these in peels before.  These ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the \"peel\" portion time to do its work.\n\nIt also has some kind of grit in it.  I'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.\n\nThis has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  Because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.\n\nThis may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  I am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while I do get some tingling when I use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use), it doesn't last -- once I wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  If you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  Maybe do a patch test first.  I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.\n\nThis is a green color, I'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  It has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and I can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and I guess the scent is just a combination of those.  Maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.\n\nI personally don't find this drying.  I think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and I'm not getting new ones, even though I am using facial oils.

It glides on like butter and creates a rich lather that feels luxurious. The raspberry scent is delightful, subtle, and not overpowering, which I appreciate.

Even with the bits of stuff I'm sure is there for exfoliation, I only sense richness.  The floral scent is light, not overpowering, and I don't notice myself wearing it after my shower is done.  The bar is much fatter than standard bars from the grocery store. Even though it feels like it melts in my hands, it actually lasts and lasts.  With this soap, I shower in the lap of luxury.\n\nProduct:\nClean &amp; Clear Deep Action Cream Facial Cleanser for Sensitive Skin, Gentle Daily Face Wash with Oil-Free, 6.5 oz (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nClean & Clear sure knows how to make a cleanser feel gentle.  It's not sudsy like a soap.  It's more like a lotion.  The scent was hard to pinpoint, but I'd say it's a bit like cucumber.  This has salicylic acid, folks, the stuff that's in acne treatment.  I should have known, I mean \"Clean & Clear,\" right? My face feels clean afterwards. The one star deduction is for the scent, which I don't think is the greatest.\n\nProduct:\nOral-B Glide Pro-Health Dental Floss, Original Floss, 50m, Pack of 6\nReview:\nThis is my favorite floss.  I do feel like my teeth are much cleaner when I use it.  Like the name says, it glides easily between my teeth, no sticking or shredding.  The plastic container is small, compact and attractive.  The minty flavor is a nice touch.\n\nProduct:\nOral-B Glide Pro-Health Dental Floss, Original Floss, 50m, Pack of 6\nReview:\nThis floss does feel softer in the hands. It is just as strong, doesn't shred and glides between teeth just as smoothly as original Glide.\n\nI could do without the mint flavor. I don't taste the flavor at all, but it makes the floss smell medicinal, not so pleasant. Usually, mint floss is refreshing, but not here. I would like this floss without flavor and will try Glide Comfort Plus Unflavored next time.\n\nProduct:\n Colgate Fluoride Toothpaste Strawberry Smash Liquid Gel 4.60 oz (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nMy daughter, a verified kid, won't use adult toothpaste.  She almost refused to use Colgate Kids toothpaste because it looks so much like adult toothpaste.  Hint to the makers: Your design team really needs to step up to the plate.  Throw some color on that tube!\n\nAfter I convinced her to use the toothpaste, she was quite happy.  Bubblegum (ahem, bubble fruit) isn't her favorite flavor, but she says it tastes just like the other sparkly toothpastes, and she likes the pump action because it's less mess than traditional tubes.  Yes, the pump and the rocket stand are definite pluses.  No more toothpaste all over the sink.  She still uses the toothpaste without complaint, so it's a thumbs up from her.\n\nProduct:\nUrban Spa Natural Bamboo and Jute Bath Mitt\nReview:\nI haven't used this mitt to hold my small soaps, but I have used it with body wash.  The jute side doesn't feel so rough when it's dry, but don't let that fool you.  It can really scrub!  And boy, are there areas of my body that need it.  The other side is bamboo fiber, which is super soft.  It holds all my body wash, maybe too well because I'm not getting quite the number of suds that I expect.  However, I do like this mitt because it scrubs me cleaner than I've felt for a long time.  Dead skin cells be gone!\n\nProduct:\nFekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Cond Us 6.6 Oz, 6.660-Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nThis looks like mousse, but it's not.  I made the mistake of putting it on my hair after I got out of the shower only to read the directions and having to rinse this stuff out of my hair.  It's conditioner.\n\nNo matter what a conditioner is advertised to do (this one is for volume), I want it to detangle my hair.  Fekkai doesn't quite cut it.  Whereas I could simply use a wet brush after using my other conditioner, with Fekkai, I also need to use my detangling comb.  There are tangles everywhere.\n\nOn the plus side, it has a pleasant scent -- supposed to be citrus and ginseng.  It's not sweet citrus, it's more like the bitter peel -- a bit strong, but not too shabby.\n\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulates sentence, compared to other writers:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'use', 'toothpaste', 'floss', 'flavor', 'feel', 'scent', 'teeth', 'much', 'without']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

The combination of these two is, without a doubt, the best offering essie has ever put out there.\n\nFirst of all, I hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. There was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that I could have gotten by with just one coat, although I put on two. The photograph shows the two coats on my hand.\nAfter doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. I've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. No problem, I just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.\nIf you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. Even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. No, I'm not exaggerating. It really is Magic.\nIt evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.\n\nAnd here is the part that I want to shout out... If all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.\nI have long complained that I don't like the Essie nail polish brushes. They're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.\nThe brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are DONE. The brush holds just the right amount of polish.\nThis review is for the VIPlease color. I think of it as a hibiscus or raspberry shade.\nIt looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. It's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.\nGetting the kit is a great way to try the top coat.\nIf your experience is as good as mine, this will be the only topcoat you ever use from now on.\n\nProduct:\nCrest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit, 1 Count\nReview:\nIf my dentist offered this kit at a good price I's snap it up in a heartbeat! Or if it was a 'get all this other stuff free when you buy the toothbrush' kind of thing. It's all you need for a healthy mouth in a re-usable little tote. And if you happen to be a dentist looking at this, there is cute little 'luggage tag' attached to it that has a sleeve for your business card. In six months when your client is using the tote for groceries, they just might look at that tag and remember to make an appointment!\n\nNow lets look at what's inside.\nFirst, there is one of those toothbrushes that syncs with a fun little device that tells you how you're brushing. GREAT for kids, but really nice for adults, too. It will even tell you if you are brushing too hard or soft. I love it! It does everything but reach in your mouth and brush FOR you.\nThe included toothpaste is slightly runny for a stand-up tube, but tastes fresh.\nNext there is the Crest mouthwash. They claim it doesn't sting, and they're right. The mint lasts just long enough, with some others it spoils your taste buds for hours.\nFinally, some dental floss. I prefer flossing picks but it certainly completes the package.\n\nThis is a terrific promo item or gift!\n\nProduct:\nUrban Spa Natural Bamboo and Jute Bath Mitt\nReview:\nAs is the case with anyone that has a drop of Nordic blood in them, I'm a huge believer in the benefits of dry brushing your skin for health.\nIf you've never tried it, you won't believe how great it makes your skin feel and look, and this brush is a wonderful tool to start with.\nFirst of all there are slight curves on the handle. This means that whether you grip the brush at the top or closer to the bottom it will be comfortable and not slip around. The bristles look to be natural, and have just the right amount of stiffness for exfoliation. Simply rub on your skin gently so that all of the dead skin flakes off.\nNext, I like to get in the shower and use the brush while it's wet to both cleanse and to use the bumpy side to massage my legs and rear.\nAfterwards, a good quality moisturizer or oil and you're all set.\n\nProduct:\nCrest Sensi-Stop Strips, 10 Count\nReview:\nEvery so often I'll switch from my favorite toothpastes to Sensodyne. I have two areas that periodically are sensitive, the dentist confirmed that it's just a sensitivity and not an issue with the teeth.\nNever have I seen this product at my local store, so was happy to test it out.\nCrest certainly knows about oral care, this product is easy to apply, and most importantly, it works. Unlike the Sensodyne, it works right away.

I have the green tea version and the fragrance is delicious! It almost has a bit of spiciness to it. Moreover, these leave a clean but not \"stripped\" or dry feeling. And, if you are careful, these won't just melt away in the shower. (If you have a little in-shower case, all the better).\n\nThis smells phenomenal, it cleans without drying, and the bars a HUGE!

It made my hair a bit smoother, but I couldn't achieve any real volume with it. The best I can say, is that it has a pleasant scent. (But those with fragrance sensitivities/allergies may find themselves bothered by it).\n\nAnd, I must agree with several reviewers who sagely noted that the components of the product are less-than-healthy. The first two times I tried the whip, I quickly washed my hands afterward. Of course, logically, it was still in my hair ... and near/on my scalp. Ultimately, this made me way too nervous to continue to use it, so I tossed it.\n\nThere are number of better, more effective, less expensive products on the market.

And completely natural! Give that one a try.\n\nProduct:\nColgate Enamel Health Mouthwash\nReview:\nI think I may be in the minority here. I really love the \"clean\" feel of Listerine (a product that is heavily endorsed by my dentist and hygienist), and genuinely missed it here. But I also use ACT ... so, I am used to products that don't necessarily provide that exciting tingle (my dentist has me use Listerine in the morning and ACT before bed). So, I replaced my Listerine with this and while my mouth didn't feel as excitingly clean, it claims to protect enamel, so that might be a nice bonus.\n\nAfter this bottle is gone, I plan on returning to Listerine (I supposed it is a part of my routine now ... and I am always loathe to deviate from the course of action my dentist plans for me). However, this seems to do no harm and could be great for those with a low-threshold for strong products like Listerine (there is a person in my family who does not use Listerine because they find it painful ... this would be ideal for her). So, if this is you, give it a try. (If you like it, then consult your dentist).\n\nProduct:\nUrban Spa Natural Bamboo and Jute Bath Mitt\nReview:\nObviously, cellulite is not affected by a brush. Simple biology reveals the massive flaws in this idea. If what one is truly seeking is to improve cellulite, one wants a cellulite creme with caffeine OR with any form of retinoid. Or a plastic surgeon. This whole topic was just explored on an episode of The Doctors.\n\nHowever, let's talk about what this brush is great for: exfoliating! One can do a light dry rub before a shower or a lighter rub during the shower (be careful, wet skin is more delicate). This will keep skin youthful if one follows up with a light moisturizer.\n\nThe brush is well-made, looks nice, and has held up well this week (it appears brand new even though it is hanging in my shower).\n\nOverall, while one doesn't want to by this for the purposes of reducing cellulite (that's not how it works), it is phenomenal for exfoliating!\n\nProduct:\nFekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Cond Us 6.6 Oz, 6.660-Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nI'll come clean here ... I totally thought this was a leave-in. I had never heard of a \"mousse-style\" rinse-out conditioner. Luckily, I read the back before even hopping into the shower.  Now, I think the scent may be polarizing. For me, it translated as \"pleasant\" and \"clean\" (I thought it smelled like a blend of citrus and mint, which I found to be a very refreshing fragrance). I think because I gravitate towards the uncommon, this registered as very likeable. Now, I definitely used WAY too much the first time. (I think I just enjoyed the texture and the experience. LOL!) So, just be careful of that. Finally, it is easy to distribute and rinsed super clean. My only concern is any potential rust from the canister. I usually leave my shampoo and conditioner in the shower area ... but I was worried that this container could stain my tub/shower (I had done this accidentally with a shave cream many years ago). So, I find myself taking this into the shower and carrying it out of the shower ... and occasionally forgetting it, wrapping a towel around me and going to grab it. I guess, I'm flummoxed by metal containers in the shower.\n\nUnderstand, the conditioning aspect is very light (so as to allow for volume and movement), so if you have damaged hair, this may not be the best choice. However, it certainly does leave plenty of bounce. By all means, it does what it claims!\n\nProduct:\nCrest Sensi-Stop Strips, 10 Count\nReview:\nThis product is considerably more expensive than a simple tube of Sensodyne and provides the similar protection. For me, it was not worth the effort, annoyance, concerns, or price. Moreover, I am left truly uncomfortable by the numerous notes of caution on the product. I think I'll simply remain faithful to my Sensodyne (which my dentist wholeheartedly endorses).\n\nAdditionally, the box does caution the user that this product has been known to NOT last the full month ... something to consider as you weigh Sensodyne against this box (of six strips). Best to use Sensodyne consistently than to end up in screaming pain because your Sensi-Strips just wore-off?
