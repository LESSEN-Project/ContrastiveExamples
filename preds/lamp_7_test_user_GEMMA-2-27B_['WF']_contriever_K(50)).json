Working tomorrow and Thursday all day, though.\nTweet:\n@SusanneUre So now is not the time to quit. Unfortunately, that's easy for ME to say. \nTweet:\n@scarlettlion I don't. I won't have transport for the Bank holiday weekend, so I prefer today, as I'm off work anyway. \nTweet:\n@1stAngel I'll be in this evening. Will go on skype. Promise!!!  Missing @yvonneayoub, too. \nTweet:\n@stran9ee Seems to have gone away now.

It's like I permanently have to be online to police my followers to do the job of #twitter. \nTweet:\n@enoxisureka Thanks for ff! Again, had no internet today in Southampton, so I'll do some next week. Although I'm working Friday again... \nTweet:\n@laura_eyedea Wish I could come with you. The lomo I bought last time is already gone. \nTweet:\n@enoxisureka I am, but I'm just not good enough! All I do is keep subsidising the prize money for someone else! I'm not THAT rich! \nTweet:\n@Cranialstrain Very true. The magazines should be full of tests soon. \nTweet:\n@RayBeckerman Well, at least it's going to be on the news here. Modern technology and democracy, but how when information is withheld? \nTweet:\n@conflagratio I know. This one was twice already in my follower list. Both wouldn't budge when blocked. \nTweet:\n@enoxisureka Fingers crossed! At 4.20pm I'll be thinking of you! \nTweet:\n@carlonicora For that alone you deserve yourself another #followfriday! \nTweet:\n@f1scoop He picked up a bit of gravel, though. \nTweet:\n@terakopian Which ones do you mean? Not my awful website that is going to go puff! in a month? I'm working on a new one. \nTweet:\n@carlonicora ...and if that is anything to go by, then the one you have in mind should be a great lens. \nTweet:\n@terakopian He's a musician, so he's a bit difficult to pin down on weekends, and during the week I'm out all the time. So it was nice. \nTweet:\n@f1fanatic_co_uk You don't really want to ask me that. ;-) I'm sure Felipe drove as well as he did the years before. It's the car. \nTweet:\nAfter a lot of time here and there away from home, I am now faced with all the stuff I dropped here and there. The place is a mess! \nTweet:\nThat horny kitty thing must be really desperate. As soon as I block it, it comes back.

Like all men, he thinks he doesn't need one, just me when he's dying from a cold. \nTweet:\nSo everyone who wants to deal with Border Agency HAS to go through their MP. Surely, that's not their job? \nTweet:\nI never thought the mess would go away while I slept, I just didn't expect it to look even worse when I woke up! \nTweet:\nOooh, I love summer thunder storms. Especially when I'm inside and the beer I just had in the sun in the park still bubbles in my belly. \nTweet:\nBusy dealing with Flavia's dance workshop pics. No time for painting kitchen walls with anti-condensation paint - again! \nTweet:\nWish I could upload the pictures but internet has been down for 3 hours or so. Not so nice. \nTweet:\nI wish all of you as lovely a Friday as I am having. See you later! Maybe with some pix of OAPs shaking it to Afro-Peruvian music. \nTweet:\nI'll be signing off for a bit. Got things to do that require my presence away from the computer. \nTweet:\nNeed to clean my desk. Papers have piled up to start blocking the lower edge of the screen... Literally drowning. \nTweet:\nOh, Adrian's trophy will become a collectors' item as soon as next year - Abbey will change their name to Santander. \n</pasttweets>\nHere are some features about your writing style:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['time', 'go', 'one', 'soon', 'away', 'bit', 'wish', 'nice', 'today', 'back']\n</features>\nFinally, here are some tweets from other users:\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nNow you will receive your last tweet:\nTweet:\n@louisehector: I always arrive at my destination without any incidents.
