Seems we're growing further apart from our neighbours at a time when we should be closer.... \nTweet:\n@pramsey You have my sympathy - I'm suffering from allergies right now, too. \nTweet:\n@vic_toria Funnel clouds = find shelter fast! By the time one touches down it might be too late to run. Sons think they're invincible. \nTweet:\n@boulderdiaries I was afraid you were going to say that. \nTweet:\n@technex Yeah, he sure could! Too bad he's no longer with us .... \nTweet:\n@l0k1 Please keep us all posted on what you choose! And maybe keep a blog?
