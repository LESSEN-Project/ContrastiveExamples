The end product is soft, moist skin. the Pre de Provence soaps are wonderful, regardless of scent. They eliminate itchy dry skin and make bath time something to look forward too.\nProduct:\nPre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry\n\nReview:\nThis must be applied with caution following the instructions exactly and with great care. Essie polish is top quality and it lasts fairly long after a manicure. It does not crack or chip, and the color is true and brilliant.\nI thought this amethyst/purple might be a bit goth, but turns out that it is perfect for Halloween when I get dressed up in full witch regalia. I normally do my nails with OPI, but I love the long lasting finish.\nProduct:\nessie Gel Couture Nail Polish\n\nReview:\nThis product is dispensed from an aerosol can. On the face of it I thought it was a mousse product. Fortunately, I read the instructions. While the product didn't indicate that the can needed to be shaken, I shook it and then dispensed a small amount in the palm of my hand and worked it through my towel dried hair. I left it on for 3 minutes and then rinsed thoroughly. I lightly towel dried my hair again and blow dried my hair with a rounded hair brush starting at the roots. My hair looked as though it had more volume, but I subsequently repeated the process this morning and applied my regular mousse before styling. My hair looked better despite the initial benefits of just this conditioner alone.\nProduct:\nFekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Cond Us 6.6 Oz, 6.660-Fluid Ounce\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, generate a review for the given product purchased by the customer.
